Prep Work/Resources
 
 1. 
    0 K8's experience when I started November 2022. Many years of professional SRE/infra experience with docker, linux, 
    cloud, etc.
 2. 
    Went thru Udemy CKAD course by Mumshad Mannambeth. Completed all hands on "Kodekloud" exercises twice. Once while 
    going thru the course and once again the week prior to the exam.
 3. 
    Completed both killer.sh practice exams. One two weekends before the exam. Second one one weekend before the exam. 
    First practice exam I scored a 63% total but scored 93% of what I attempted. Second practice exam I scored a 78% 
    total but scored 93% of what I attempted.
 4. 
    Went thru all these exercises twice with my personal ubuntu desktop server:

Exam Environment Heads Up
 
 1. 
    I had major issues with my webcam focusing on my ID during ID verification process. We tried everything and the exam
    almost had to be canceled. I had to run to a neighbors and borrow a different webcam. BE SURE your webcam can get a 
    clear video/picture of your ID. There were no alternative methods for identification. I have already purchased a 
    nicer webcam so I don't face this problem in future!
 2. 
    As a MAC user I had to get used to SHIFT + CTRL + C for copy and SHIFT + CTRL + V for paste.
 3. 
    Most questions you will do significantly less work than required in the killer.sh exams.
 4. 
    Be sure to read the instructions very carefully. Many times I felt the pull to start modifying some resources but 
    the instructions will often tell you what you SHOULD and SHOULD NOT modify.
 5. 
    I connected 25 minutes before my exam. It took the proctor 5 minutes to connect and then 10 minutes to actually 
    start chatting. Because of the ID and focusing issues it took about 54 minutes to finally get into the exam. I ended
    up getting to the exam one minute before it is considered "too late". This caused a lot of unnecessary stress and 
    discomfort to start off the exam.
 6. 
    I did not need my phone at all during check in process. I also did not need my speakers at all and was asked to turn
    them off.
 7. 
    I did not find the latency/VM bad at all, but I use a very reliable high bandwidth wired connection.
