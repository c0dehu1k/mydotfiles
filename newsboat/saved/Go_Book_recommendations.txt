Hello, everyone. I was wondering if you could recommend some good books to learn Golang, and backend applications. As 
for the basics of the language, I'm studying The Go Programming Language (Donovan & Kernighan). It's an interesting 
book, but from my point of view, there aren't many exercises, and I think that compromises the quality of the study. 
Regarding backend applications, I started with Go Web Programming (Sau Sheong Chang), and to my surprise, it's an 
excellent book! It gives a good overview of the main packages. Even so, I need more book recommendations. I know that 
most developers like to study through courses, but I have this habit of taking my first steps in some new technology 
through books.
